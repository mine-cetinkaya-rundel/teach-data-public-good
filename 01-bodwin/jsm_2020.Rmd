# A quick grading exercise

# The Question:

In 1952, a group of scientists decided to study the effect of Vitamin C supplements
on tooth growth.  They gathered a set of 60 guinea pigs, and gave half the animals
pure vitamin C and half the animals Orange Juice.  They then measured the length
of the guinea pigs' incisor teeth.

The results of the study are summarized below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_tabs <- ToothGrowth %>%
  group_by(supp) %>%
  summarize(`Mean Tooth Length` = mean(len), 
            `SD of Tooth Length` = sd(len),
            `Sample Size` = n()) %>%
  rename(`Supplement Type` = supp) %>%
  mutate(
    `Supplement Type` = factor(`Supplement Type`, 
                               levels = c("OJ", "VC"), 
                               labels = c("Orange Juice", "Vitamin C")),
  ) 

my_tabs %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE)  %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```

Is there evidence at the 0.05 level that the orange juice is more beneficial to tooth
growth than Vitamin C supplements?

---
# The Correct Answer

```{r, include = FALSE}
t.test(len ~ supp, ToothGrowth, alternative = "greater")
```

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;">
With a t-score of <b>1.91</b>, we get a p-value of <b>0.03</b>.
<br>
There <b>is evidence</b> that Orange Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
</p>

The mean of the OJ group is about 4mm above the mean of the VC group.  This

# Technique 1:
# "Imaginary Results"


---

# Imaginary Results

**Before** you examine any data, ask students to imagine what they **might**
observe.

--

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;">
<b> ACTIVITY </b> 
<br>
<ul>
<li> Choose a research question from the supplied list. </li>
<li> Imagine a dataset that might address this research question.  Write down your
dataset, inventing possible numbers for the first few rows. </li>
<li> Sketch a visualization that summarizes the data in your imaginary dataset.
What might it look like, and what would you conclude? </li>
</p>

---
# Example
.center[
![](activity.jpeg)

---
# "Imaginary Results"

* Trains students to **think** before they **assess**.

--

* Helps prevent **mismatch** between the *research question* and the *dataset*

--

* Fosters *good instincts*.

---

# Technique 2: 
# "Expectations vs. Reality"

---
# Expectations vs. Reality

Ask students to write down:

--

* What did you **expect to see** if the answer to the research question is "no"?

--

* What did you **expect to see** if the answer to the research question is "yes"?

--

* What did you **actually** see?

# Expectations vs Reality

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;">
<b> Research Question: </b> Do CSM students get more sleep than CLA students?
<br><br>
<b> Expect if yes: </b> The average hours of sleep among CSM students in this class
will be a bigger number than the average hours among CLA students.
<br><br>
<b> Expect if no: </b>  The average hours of sleep will be about the same.
<br><br>
<b> Actually saw: </b>  In this class 15 CLA students averaged 7.1 hours/night and 
17 CSM students averaged 7.6 hours/night.
</p>

Good discussion Qs:

- Why "about the same", not "CLA gets *more* hours"?

- Why not "exactly the same"?

---
# Expectations vs Reality

Benefits of these activities:

--

* Primes students for the notion of a **null** and **alternate** hypothesis.

--

* Prompts discussion of **statistics** versus **parameters**.

--

* Gets students thinking about strength of **evidence**

# What would convince you?

Advantages:

--

* Gets students thinking about **strength of evidence** and **critical values**

--

* Primes students for **Type I** and **Type II** error

--

* Forces students to **commit** to a significance level **before** seeing the data

# Midterm 1

(Week 4 of 10)

We **have** studied:

* types of variables

* data visualization

* *statistics* and *parameters*

* center and spread

* the 68-95-99 rule for bell curves

* the variance of the sample mean shrinks by $n$

* sample means usually follow a bell curve

---
# Midterm 1

(Week 4 of 10)

We **have not** studied:

* anything about distributions or densities

* any part of a formal hypothesis test of any kind

* anything about confidence intervals

<p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;">
Professor Snape is a teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
In his classes, final grades out of 100 are always curved to a mean of 60. 
<br><br>
At Hogwarts, students are assigned to one of four houses.  Headmaster Dumbledore suspects that Prof. Snape is unfairly favoring students in his favorite house, Slytherin.  
<br><br>
He investigates, and finds that the average grade of the 70 students in Slytherin House was 65, with
a standard deviation of 8.
<br><br>
Dumbledore has hired to you do an analysis of this situation.  What do you conclude, and why?

# What's the punchline?
---
# Takeaway messages

1. Basic data summaries and visualizations are **not** "building blocks" to a greater goal.
They are the core of every analysis.

--

2. A well-reasoned, informal analysis is **much better than** a formal statistical
analysis that lacks intuition.

--

3. Removing **all** concrete procedures from the first part of a class encourages **conceptual thought**.

--

4. Intuition and concepts **can be deliberately taught in a classroom environment**.
