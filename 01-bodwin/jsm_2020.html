# A quick grading exercise

# The Question:

In 1952, a group of scientists decided to study the effect of Vitamin C supplements
on tooth growth.  They gathered a set of 60 guinea pigs, and gave half the animals
pure vitamin C and half the animals Orange Juice.  They then measured the length
of the guinea pigs' incisor teeth.

The results of the study are summarized below:

&lt;table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Mean Tooth Length &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; SD of Tooth Length &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Sample Size &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Supplement Type &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 20.66333 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 6.605561 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 30 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Orange Juice &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 16.96333 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 8.266029 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 30 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Vitamin C &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Is there evidence at the 0.05 level that the orange juice is more beneficial to tooth
growth than Vitamin C supplements?  Justify your answer.

# The Correct Answer



&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;"&gt;
With a t-score of &lt;b&gt;1.91&lt;/b&gt;, we get a p-value of &lt;b&gt;0.03&lt;/b&gt;.

There &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; at the 0.05 level that Orange Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

# Student A

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:red; padding: 1em;"&gt;
With a t-score of &lt;b&gt;1.91&lt;/b&gt;, we get a p-value of &lt;b&gt;0.03&lt;/b&gt;.  

There &lt;font color = "red"&gt;&lt;b&gt; is not evidence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; at the 0.05 level that Orange 
Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

There &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; at the 0.05 level that Orange Juice leads to more tooth growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

# Student B

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:red; padding: 1em;"&gt;
With a t-score of &lt;font color = "red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;-1.91&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, we get a p-value of &lt;font color = "red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;0.03&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.  

There &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; at the 0.05 level that &lt;font color = "red"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/font&gt; leads to more tooth growth than &lt;font color = "red"&gt;Orange Juice&lt;/font&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;"&gt;
With a t-score of &lt;b&gt;1.91&lt;/b&gt;, we get a p-value of &lt;b&gt;0.03&lt;/b&gt;.  

There &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; at the 0.05 level that Orange Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

---
# Student C


&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:red; padding: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;font color = "red"&gt;The standard deviation of the mean for the OJ group is 1.2.
The mean of the OJ group is about 4mm above the mean of the VC group.  This
difference is a lot bigger than the standard deviation. &lt;/font&gt;

Thus, I think there &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; that Orange Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

across the two supplement types.

**Student A:**


&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; padding: 1em;"&gt;
With a t-score of &lt;b&gt;1.91&lt;/b&gt;, we get a p-value of &lt;b&gt;0.03&lt;/b&gt;.  

There &lt;b&gt; is not evidence&lt;/b&gt; at the 0.05 level that Orange 
Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

**Student B:**

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; padding: 1em;"&gt;
With a t-score of &lt;b&gt;-1.91&lt;/b&gt;, we get a p-value of &lt;b&gt;0.03&lt;/b&gt;.  

There &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; at the 0.05 level that Vitamin C leads to more tooth growth than Orange Juice.
&lt;/p&gt;

**Student C:**

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; padding: 1em;"&gt;
The standard deviation of the mean for the OJ group is 1.2.
The mean of the OJ group is about 4mm above the mean of the VC group.  This
difference is a lot bigger than the standard deviation. 

Thus, I think there &lt;b&gt;is evidence&lt;/b&gt; that Orange Juice leads to more tooth
growth than Vitamin C.
&lt;/p&gt;

--

I argue that **Student C** deserves the highest grade.

# Being able to draw 
# **reasonable conclusions from data**
# is *way more important* than
# being able to perform a hypothesis test.

---

&gt; It will not be
helpful for students to know about the tools and procedures that can be used to analyze data if
students don’t first understand the underlying concepts. Having a good understanding of the
concepts will make it easier for students to use necessary tools and procedures to answer
particular questions about a dataset.
Procedural steps too often claim students’ attention that an effective teacher could otherwise
direct toward concepts.

# A Traditional Statistics Class

[pic of "mountain climbing" through the steps of summaries &amp; viz, test stats,
p-values, interpretation]

---

&gt; We do not advocate one particular conception of the investigative process, nor do we
recommend a specific number of stages or steps in this process; we do strongly recommend that
instructors emphasize the investigative nature of the field of statistics throughout their
introductory course. [...]
&gt; We recommend that throughout the entire introductory course, instructors illustrate
the complete investigative cycle with every example/exercise presented, starting with the
motivating question that led to the data collection and ending with the scope of conclusions and
directions for future work.

# An "Inside-Out" Statistics Class

[pic of target with "reasoning from summaries", then "reasoning from test stats"
then "formal testing"]

---

&gt; Effective statistical thinking requires seeing connections among statistical ideas and
recognizing that most statistical questions can be solved with a variety of procedures and that
there is often more than one acceptable solution. 

BUT

&gt; It can be challenging to present material in a way that facilitates students’ development
of more than just a surface level understanding of important concepts and ideas.

# Imaginary Results

# “Imaginary Results”

**Before** you examine any data, ask students to imagine what they *might*
observe.

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt; ACTIVITY &lt;/b&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Choose a research question from the supplied list. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Imagine a dataset that might address this research question.  Write down your
dataset, inventing possible numbers for the first few rows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sketch a visualization that summarizes the data in your imaginary dataset.
What might it look like, and what would you conclude? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

# Expectations vs. Reality

Ask students to write down:

--

* What did you **expect to see** if the answer to the research question is "no"?

--

* What did you **expect to see** if the answer to the research question is "yes"?

--

* What did you **actually** see?

# Expectations vs Reality

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Research Question: &lt;/b&gt; Do CSM students get more sleep than CLA students?

&lt;b&gt; Expect if yes: &lt;/b&gt; The average hours of sleep among CSM students in this class
will be a bigger number than the average hours among CLA students.

&lt;b&gt; Expect if no: &lt;/b&gt;  The average hours of sleep will be about the same.

&lt;b&gt; Actually saw: &lt;/b&gt;  In this class 15 CLA students averaged 7.1 hours/night and 
17 CSM students averaged 7.6 hours/night.
&lt;/p&gt;

--

Good discussion Qs:

- Why "about the same", not "CLA gets *more* hours"?

- Why not "exactly the same"?

---
# Expectations vs Reality

Benefits of these activities:

--

* Primes students for the notion of a **null** and **alternate** hypothesis.
--

* Prompts discussion of **statistics** versus **parameters**.

--

* Gets students thinking about strength of **evidence**

--

* Primes students for **Type I** and **Type II** error
--

* Forces students to **commit** to a significance level **before** seeing the data

# Midterm 1

(Week 4 of 10)

We **have** studied:

* types of variables

* data visualization

* *statistics* and *parameters*

* comparing across groups, with scaling by s.d.

* the 68-95-99 rule

* the fact that the variance of the sample mean shrinks by `\(n\)`

* the fact that sample means are approx. Normal

--

We **have not** studied:

* anything about distributions or densities

* any part of a formal hypothesis test of any kind

* anything about confidence intervals

# Midterm 1


&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;"&gt;
Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape are teachers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

In Prof. McGonagall's classes, final grades (out of 100) are always curved to have a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 5.  In Prof. Snape's classes, final grades out of 100 are always curved to a mean of 60 and standard deviation of 8. 

At HOgwarts, students are assigned to one of four houses.  Headmaster Dumbledore suspects that Prof. Snape is unfairly favoring students in his favorite house, Slytherin.  Among the 70 students in Slytherin House, this year the mean final grade in Snape's class was 65.


Dumbledore has hired to you do an analysis of this situation.  What do you conclude, and why?
&lt;/p&gt;

# Midterm 2

Data handout, plus:

&lt;p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#6495ed; padding: 1em;"&gt;
Choose any two of the following research questions to answer with a formal hypothesis test at the 0.05 level.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does most chocolate flavored candies come in bar form? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are chocolate flavored candies more likely contain caramel than non-chocolate candies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the sugar content higher in chocolate flavored candy, or in non-chocolate candy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does candy tend to be composed of less than 50\% sugar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Be sure to state which research question you are addressing.  Please put separate tests on separate pages.
&lt;/p&gt;

# What's the punchline?
---
# Takeaway messages

1. Basic data summaries and visualizations are **not** "building blocks" to a greater goal.

--

2. Removing **all** formal structure from the analyses encourages conceptual thought.

--

3. A well-reasoned, informal analysis is **much better than** a formal statistical
analysis that lacks intuition.

--

4. Intuition and concepts **can be deliberately taught in a classroom environment**.
