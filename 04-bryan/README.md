Me, in previous life as University of British Columbia stats prof

-   STAT 545 (Exploratory?) Data Analysis grad course
-   STAT 540 Statistics for High Dimensional Biology
-   Master of Data Science

Inside-Out Statistics | Bodwin
------------------------------

-   Ack, grading! Don’t miss it at all.
-   “want to hire?”, unofficial grad rubric
-   Misguided litigation re: confidence interval verbiage
-   Predict what you’ll see: Either you were right (I win!) or learn
    something / correct a mistake (I win!)
-   Pre-commit to what would convince you –&gt; harder to move the goal

Who’s Underrepresented? | Tackett
---------------------------------

-   Transform/Visualize vs Model, oh yaasss  
    In practice vs In class  
    80/20 20/80
-   Tension between using real data but also MAKING SURE, e.g. missing
    data comes up a lot. So hard to find the right data and keep it
    fresh. Bodwin and Tackett are working real data into courses with
    very different goals. The more specialized the mandate
    (“regression”), the harder it is to find real-world data, because
    extra constraints?
-   Difficulty around simply getting the data out of awkward
    places/formats and into students hands quickly.

Difficult Dialogues | Hardin
----------------------------

-   “Goldilocks level of data wrangling” Ha! So hard to get this “just
    right”.
-   “Each student can work with a different dataset” &lt;– neat way to
    get this w/o impractical explosion of variety
-   “Ability (need!) to work with SQL” &lt;– “Teaching-driven personal
    growth”
-   How to communicate: the kind of thing it’s tempting to shy away from
    because “it’s not statistics”, but learning to communicate is
    equipping students for the future. Similar to the attitudes re:
    teaching programming.

General remarks and discussion points
-------------------------------------

The more applied, real-world the course, the more it exposed gaps in
what I was a pro at. Not being the expert all the time. Is this more or
less risky or rewarding if you already don’t meet the prof stereotype?

Risks vs. rewards of working with, e.g., data on COVID, slave trade,
policing. One person’s topical is another persons lived experience. How
do you do this with great empathy and humility? Also important to
compare to realistic baseline: people weren’t 100% happy with the
existing “tired” datasets, so you can’t expect to make everyone
perfectly happy with new “read world” datasets either.
